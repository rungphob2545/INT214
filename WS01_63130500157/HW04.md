## Part 1: Explore the dataset

```
# Library
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
library("ggplot2")
library(forcats)

#Load data
books <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/safesit23/INT214-Statistics/main/datasets/prog_book.csv")
view(books)
```


This dataset holds a list of 270 books in the field of computer science and programming related topics.
The list of books was constructed using many popular websites which provide information on book ratings an of all the book in those websites the 270 most popular were selected.


## Part 2: Learning function from Tidyverse

- Function `fct_lump()` from package [forcats](https://forcats.tidyverse.org/articles/forcats.html)). used to set the number of rows want to show.

```
books %>% mutate(Type = fct_lump(Type,n=3)) %>% count(Type, sort = TRUE)
```
** You can sepearate this part or combine in part of `Transform data with dplyr and finding insight the data`

## Part 4: Visualization with GGplot2
### 1.) The bar chart represents the Number Of Pages average of Type Book.
```
Page_plot <- books %>% mutate(Type = fct_lump(Type,n=5)) %>%  group_by(Type) %>%
  summarise(Number_Of_Pages = mean(Number_Of_Pages, na.rm = TRUE))

Page_plot <- Page_plot %>% ggplot(aes(x = fct_infreq(Type),y = Number_Of_Pages,fill=Type)) + geom_bar(stat="identity") 

Page_plot + ggtitle("Number Of Pages average of Type Book") + xlab("Type") + ylab("Number Of Pages average")
```
Result:

![Graph 1](plot1.png)


### 2.) Book price charts go up and down about ratings and reviews.

```
bookPrice_plot <- books %>% select(Book_title,Price,Reviews,Rating) %>% filter(Reviews > mean(Reviews, na.rm = TRUE))

bookPrice_plot <- bookPrice_plot %>% ggplot(aes(x = Rating,y = Reviews,color=Price)) + geom_line() + geom_point()

bookPrice_plot + ggtitle("Book price charts go up and down about ratings and reviews.") +
  xlab("Rating") + ylab("Reviews")
```
